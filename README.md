# Coast CLI Alpha

## What is this?

This is the command-line interface for interacting with the Coast web framework for Clojure. It won't be long before you can say: "if you've used Coast, you've used this."

## Janet?

Yes, [Janet](https://janet-lang.org)! Janet is a handy little lisp that compiles down to binaries ready for distribution.

## Getting Started

Soon we'll have binary releases you can download, but for now you can [install Janet](https://janet-lang.org/docs/index.html) then use the [jpm](https://janet-lang.org/docs/jpm.html) tool to interact with the project.
